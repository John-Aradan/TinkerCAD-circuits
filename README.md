# TinkerCAD-circuits
The collection in Tinkercad consists of three different circuits designed for Arduino Uno. The first circuit is an LED/Button interface with debounce logic, which prevents false readings from the button contacts. The second circuit is a DC motor speed control circuit with a potentiometer and motor driver to protect the Arduino from voltage spikes and current surges. The third circuit is an LED cycle with potentiometer speed control and pause/resume button, where 4 LEDs glow in a cycle controlled by a potentiometer, and a push button can pause/resume the cycle at any time.
1. "Arduino Uno LED/Button Interface": This circuit interfaces a LED and a button with Arduino Uno. On pressing the button, the LED starts glowing, and when released, the LED turns off.
2. "Arduino Uno DC Motor Speed Control Circuit with Potentiometer and Motor Driver": This circuit controls the speed of a DC motor using a potentiometer and a motor driver connected to Arduino Uno. The potentiometer allows for variable speed control of the motor, while the motor driver helps to protect the Arduino from voltage spikes and current surges.
3. "Arduino Uno LED Cycle with Potentiometer Speed Control and Pause/Resume Button": This circuit consists of 4 LEDs that glow one after the other in a cycle, where the delay between the 4 different states is controlled by a potentiometer. The circuit also includes a push button that can be used to pause/resume the LED cycle at any time.
